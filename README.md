- PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This is a graphical implementation of the famous and innovative game called Tic-Tac-Toe                    
- DATE: 5/6/2020                             
- HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Go to release file, download the binary, and follow instructions in the release.
- AUTHOR: Nhan man                          
- USER INSTRUCTIONS: It's a tic tac toe game.
- PROBLEM: I have to make a tic tac toe program to pass C++.

## How I Make The Masterpiece

### The AI
I actually have much greater plan for the AI. I wanted to make the AI to play the perfect tic tac toe game, however I couldn't be bothered. So, the current AI uses random number generator to move.

### The Board
I utilized advanced C++ techniques such as multi-dimensional array and looping to create the ultimate tic tac toe experience.

### The Winning Condition
I just use a bunch of for loops and hope for the best. (Honestly, this was probably the easiest part)

## Build With
- C++ - Programming Language
- SDL2 - Graphics and Controls Library
- Visual Studio - IDE
